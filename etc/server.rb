# OverSIP - Server Logic.
#




### Custom Application Code:


# Define here your custom code for the application running on top of OverSIP.
# Here you can load thirdy-party libraries and so on.
#
# require "some-gem"
#
module MyExampleApp
  extend ::OverSIP::Logger

  class << self
    attr_reader :do_outbound_mangling, :do_user_assertion
  end

  # Set this to _true_ if the SIP registrar behind OverSIP does not support Path.
  # OverSIP::Modules::OutboundMangling methods will be used.
  @do_outbound_mangling = true

  # Set this to _true_ if the SIP proxy/server behind OverSIP performing the authentication
  # is ready to accept a P-Asserted-Identity header from OverSIP indicating the already
  # asserted SIP user of the client's connection (this avoids authenticating all the requests
  # but the first one).
  # OverSIP::Modules::UserAssertion methods will be used.
  @do_user_assertion = true
end




### OverSIP System Events:


# This method is called when the main configuration files have been loaded.
# Place here 3rd party modules initializer code.
# This method is not executed again when OverSIP is reloaded (HUP signal).
#
# def (OverSIP::SystemEvents).on_initialize
#   [...]
# end


# This method is called once the OverSIP reactor has been started.
#
# def (OverSIP::SystemEvents).on_started
#   [...]
# end


# This method is called when a USR1 signal is received by OverSIP main
# process and allows the user to set custom code to be executed
# or reloaded.
#
# def (OverSIP::SystemEvents).on_user_reload
#   [...]
# end


# This method is called after OverSIP has been terminated. It's called
# with argument "error" which is _true_ in case OverSIP has died in an
# unexpected way.
#
# def (OverSIP::SystemEvents).on_terminated error
#   [...]
