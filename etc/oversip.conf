# OverSIP - Main configuration file.

# IMPORTANT:
#   This is a YAML [1] format configuration file. DON'T USE tab for indentation
#   as it's not allowed and would raise unexpected errors. Instead, respect

core:

  # DNS nameserver to use. Note that OverSIP requires a recursive DNS server
  # (recommended unbound: a DNS recursive and caching DNS resolver).
  # Value can be:
  # - An IPv4.
  # - An array of IPv4 (for failover).
  # - _null_: nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf are used.
  # Default value is _null_.
  #
  nameservers: null

  # By default 5061.
  #

  # runs an instance of Stud TLS proxy which communicates with OverSIP using
  # plain TCP.

  # - _null_: no one, just local IP's are matched as local destinations.
  # Default value is _null_.
  #
  # local domains: [ example.net, sip.example.org ]
  local_domains: null

  # TCP keepalive interval (in seconds).
  # When acting as a TCP server, OverSIP sends TCP packets with null data payload
  # as described in http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/.
  # If not set, TCP keepalive is dissabled.
  # Minimun value is 180 seconds. Default value is _null_ (not enabled).
  #
  tcp_keepalive_interval: 300

  # Use a hostname for Record-Route/Path header when using TLS or WSS transports
  # over IPv4 (rather than using the server IP). This is good when a peer
  # sends us an in-dialog request via TLS so it could check whether the host part
  # of the top Route header matches a domain in the certificate we provide to it.
  # If not set, the server IPv4 will be used.
  # Default value is _null_ (IPv4 is used).
  #
  # record_route_hostname_tls_ipv4: outbound.example.net
  record_route_hostname_tls_ipv4: null

  # The same for IPv6.
  # If not set, the server IPv6 will be used.

  #
  ws_keepalive_interval: 300


# TLS parameters affect to any interface of OverSIP using TLS, including SIP and WebSocket.
tls:

  # Server TLS public certificate. It must be the name of a readable file containing a
  # chain of X509 certificates in PEM format, with the most-resolved certificate at the
  # top of the file, successive intermediate certs in the middle, and the root (or CA)
  # cert at the bottom.
  # If not set, TLS is dissabled. Default value is _null_.
  # If a relative path is given, it's searched under the tls/ directoy in the OverSIP
  # configuration directory (typically /etc/oversip/).
  #
  public_cert: demo-tls.oversip.net.crt

  # Server TLS private certificate. It must be the name of a readable file containing a
  # private key in the PEM format.
  # If not set, TLS is dissabled. Default value is _null_.
  # If a relative path is given, it's searched under the tls/ directoy in the OverSIP
  # configuration directory (typically /etc/oversip/).
  # NOTE: The private key MUST NOT require password.
  #
  private_cert: demo-tls.oversip.net.key

  # Directory of TLS CAs. It must be the name of a readable directory. Every file in
  # that directory will be inspected and every X509 certificate in PEM format extracted.
  # This is useful for storing the list of trusted CAs (i.e. http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
  # or CAs not in a standard trust hierarchy.
  # This is *required* for validating certificates provided by remote peers.
  # If _null_ this feature is dissabled. Default value is _null_.
  # If a relative path is given, it's searched under the tls/ directoy in the OverSIP
  # configuration directory (typically /etc/oversip/).
