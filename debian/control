Description: OverSIP (the SIP framework you dreamed about)
  OverSIP is an async SIP proxy/server programmable in Ruby language.
  Some features of OverSIP are:
  - SIP transports: UDP, TCP, TLS and WebSocket.
  - Full IPv4 and IPv6 support.
  - RFC 3263: SIP DNS mechanism (NAPTR, SRV, A, AAAA) for failover and load
    balancing based on DNS.
  - RFC 5626: OverSIP is a perfect Outbound Edge Proxy, including an integrated
    STUN server.
  - Fully programmable in Ruby language (make SIP easy).
  - Fast and efficient: OverSIP core is coded in C language.
  OverSIP is build on top of EventMachine-LE async library which follows the Reactor
  Design Pattern, allowing thousands of concurrent connections and requests in a
  never-blocking fashion.
